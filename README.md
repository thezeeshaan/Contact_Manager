# Contact Manager â€“ Tria Assignment

Overview:
This project is a single-page React application that implements a simplified contact list as part of the Tria frontend assignment.

Objective:
- Assess frontend skills: React, API interaction, component design, and product sense.
- Build a Contact List page with the ability to view, search, and add contacts.

Features:
- View Contacts: See the list of all contacts.
- Search Contacts: Search for contacts by name using the search bar (filters as you type).
- Add Contact: Add a new contact to the list.

Tech Stack:
- Framework: React (bootstrapped with Create React App)
- Libraries: (List any extra libraries you used, e.g. UI kits, form libraries, etc.)
- API/Data: Data is mocked/hardcoded in the UI (no backend).

## Setup & Running Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd contact_manager
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at (https://contact-manager-iota-six.vercel.app/)(http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment
- The app is deployed on Vercel: (https://contact-manager-iota-six.vercel.app/)

## Assumptions & Design Choices
- Data fetching is simulated (no real API calls).
- Minimal error handling and loading states due to assignment scope.
- UI/UX is kept simple and clean, but can be extended.
- (Mention any other design/product assumptions here)

## Notable Libraries Used
- (E.g. Semantic ui for components, Formik for forms, etc. If none, remove this section)

## Project Structure
- `/src/components`: React components (ContactList, ContactCard, SearchBar, etc.)
- `/src/App.js`: Main application logic

## How AI Was Used
- AI tools assisted in code suggestions and documentation, but all final code and design decisions reflect my own understanding and best practices.
